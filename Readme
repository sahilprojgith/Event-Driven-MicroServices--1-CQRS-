These are the steps I followed...

I built this repo while learning CQRS, inspired by Daily Code Buffer.

How it works in this project:
A client sends a Command (e.g., CreateProductCommand).
The Aggregate (@Aggregate) validates the command and applies an Event.
The Event (e.g., ProductCreatedEvent) is persisted in the Event Store.
An Event Handler / Projection listens for the event and updates the Read Model.
A client issues a Query, which is served directly from the read model.

# Clone the repo
git clone repo
cd this-repo

# Start the app
mvn clean spring-boot:run

Send a POST request to create a product (command).
Observe the event being published and stored.
Send a GET request to fetch products (query).
